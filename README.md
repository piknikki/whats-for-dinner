* Once you see the option that's been chosen randomly for you, you can "heart" it to save to your 
favorites. See your favorites any time by clicking the "Show my favorites" button (if it's not clickable, 
  that means you don't have any faves yet -- get to clickin'!).
* Now that you've got some favorites, you can see the list of them, but what if you remember that you don't 
  have the stuff to make that meal?? Fear not, intrepid eater! You can delete it by double clicking on it! Once 
  your favorites are all deleted, you will no longer see that favorites window -- so search some more and 
  . . . get to clickin'!
* You can even add your own ideas by clicking on the "Add a recipe" button up in the navigation bar.
